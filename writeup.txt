The g function was implemented by calculating the meter distance between
one pixel to the next and multiplying it by the terrain speed
The h function is the distance from the current coordinate to the goal
coordinate divided by the terrain speed of the current coordinate. An
extra 50 is added if the direction is the "wrong" way

This is probably not admissible
h(x) should not be greater than c(x) since the division, however
I'm not sure that is the case, since I am multiplying the distance
times the speed and then dividing it by 4. If we go into a lake, but
only for a little bit, then the h-cost would be way too high.
